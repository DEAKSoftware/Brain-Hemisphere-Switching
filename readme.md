# Dots: Test Brain Hemisphere Switching

Dominik Deák


## 1 Introduction

Research in neuropsychology suggests that the human brain constantly switches between the two hemispheres, as if consciousness alternates from one hemisphere to another, in a cyclic fashion. Experiences, such as Motion-Induced Blindness and binocular rivalry, might be explained by the perceptual oscillations that occur in the brain. I have written a program that allows individuals to test themselves and observe the effects of brain hemisphere switching.


## 2 Instructions

When you run the [Dots](./binaries) application, you should see 5 yellow dots appear, surrounded by a swirling blue points in the background. Now stare at the middle yellow dot. You will start to notice that the surrounding yellow dots will disappear then reappear. When the yellow points disappear, the brain hemisphere that is responsible for visualising the overall picture dominates. If you notice the yellow dots reappear, your other brain hemisphere takes control. Interestingly, sometimes you will notice that diagonally opposite yellow dots will also disappear, depending on the direction of the swirling dots is moving.

To measure the switching rate of your brain, time yourself with a stop watch for 30 seconds and count the number of times you see the yellow dots reappear after they disappear.

Apparently 4 to 6 switching per 30 seconds is considered to be "normal". Most mathematicians have a rate below that. Performance artist, such as musicians, have a switching rate above 6.
